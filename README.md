# About Me

A full-time developer who loves tech and building things. Might build something new in the future if I have an idea for it.

## My Projects

These are some projects that I have worked on. Criticism of my work is welcomed and appreciated!

### [Smart Home Management System (Final Year Project)](https://github.com/bench352/cs4514fyp)

Smart Home Management System is a cloud-based building management solution for furnished apartment buildings, with real-time anomaly detection using machine learning techniques. The system adopts a microservice architecture and is deployable to a Kubernetes cluster.

### [Prior2Do](https://github.com/bench352/prior2do)

Prior2Do is a to-do app that lets you plan your tasks. With the included Task Plan feature, you can schedule a date for working on the task and estimate how much time you need to finish it. A separate, deployable server is also available for backup and syncing your tasks across multiple devices.
